# My Personal Portfolio ❤️

This is one of the biggest projects I have ever completed. It is of my portfolio which contains a paragraph based on who I am, my skills and my projects. 

### Features
The features are very subtle, for example when hovered some of the contents change to a different colour or when navigating the navigation tab forms and X to close the tab. 

### What programming languages did I use?
I used HTML, CSS and JS.

### Why did I do this project?
This project is to showcase my skills and to always look for room for improvment in order to better myself in the near future.
